# Spoken Language Identification :speaking_head:

## Introduction
The process of detecting language from an audio clip by an unknown speaker, regardless of gender, manner of speaking, and distinct age speaker, is defined as spoken language identification (SLID). In this project we aim to identify the spoken language by using deep learning models 

## Dataset

- CNN (enhanced model)

## Final Result
- MLP Accuracy: 70%
- CNN Accuracy: 93%
